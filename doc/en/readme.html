  <h1>Typing &amp; Spelling Rate</h1>
  <p class="meta">
    <strong>Author:</strong> Amir Soleimani<br>
    <strong>NVDA compatibility:</strong> 2026.1 and later
  </p>

  <h2>What this add-on does</h2>
  <p>
    This add-on lets you set a faster (or slower) speech rate specifically for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typing echo</strong> (characters and words), and</li>
    <li><strong>Spelling</strong> (spelling output spoken by NVDA).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These rates are independent from your normal synthesizer rate. Your main speech rate is not changed.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this add-on exists</h2>
  <p>
    Many users prefer a comfortable speech rate for general reading and navigation, but want a
    higher rate for rapid typing feedback or spelling—especially when editing text.
    NVDA's standard speech rate is global, so changing it affects everything.
    This add-on provides separate rates so you can keep your normal rate while still getting fast, crisp feedback when you type or spell.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works (technical note)</h2>
  <p>
    NVDA speaks using a sequence of speech commands. This add-on injects a <code>RateCommand</code>
    into the speech sequence <em>only for the specific typing/spelling utterance</em>.
    It does <strong>not</strong> change the synthesizer's global rate setting, which helps keep the behavior stable and compatible with other add-ons.
  </p>

  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <p>
    Open NVDA Settings and locate the add-on's settings panel under the <strong>Typing &amp; Spelling Rate</strong> panel.
  </p>

  <h3>Enable separate typing rate</h3>
  <p>
    When checked, the add-on applies your configured typing rate to typing echo output.
    When unchecked, typing echo uses your normal synthesizer rate.
  </p>

  <h3>Enable separate spelling rate</h3>
  <p>
    When checked, the add-on applies your configured spelling rate to spelling output.
    When unchecked, spelling uses your normal synthesizer rate.
  </p>

  <h3>Typing rate</h3>
  <p>
    Adjusts the rate used for typing echo (characters and words) when <em>Enable separate typing rate</em> is checked.
  </p>

  
  <h3>Also apply to typed words</h3>
  <p>
    When checked, the typing rate is applied to both typed <strong>characters</strong> and typed <strong>words</strong>.
    When unchecked, the typing rate is applied only to typed characters.
  </p>

<h3>Spelling rate</h3>
  <p>
    Adjusts the rate used for spelling output when <em>Enable separate spelling rate</em> is checked.
  </p>

  <h3>Windows OneCore: Boost</h3>
  <p>
    If your synthesizer is <strong>Windows OneCore</strong>, the add-on provides an extra <strong>Boost</strong> option.
    OneCore can behave differently at high rates, so Boost gives additional headroom without changing NVDA's global rate slider range.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boost range:</strong> 0–100</li>
    <li><strong>Boost is only used with Windows OneCore.</strong> It has no effect with other synthesizers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Test buttons</h3>
  <p>
    The panel includes two test buttons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Test typing</strong>: speaks a short sample using the typing rate settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Test spelling</strong>: speaks a short sample using the spelling rate settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The sample includes both characters and words (for example: <code>A B C, hello world</code>) so you can judge the rate quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This add-on targets NVDA 2026.1+ (64-bit).</li>
    <li>Settings are stored per synthesizer, so different synthesizers can have different typing/spelling rates.</li>
  </ul>
